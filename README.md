# TicTacToe with Classes

## Overview
Play Tic Tac Toe in the console.

## Use

It will start by prompting for username and symbol for each player. Follow the prompts. Usernames can be only one word (numbers OK) and symbols can only be a single capital letter. Once both players' information has been provided, the game will begin.

If player 1 input "Brent" as their name, the output should look like this at the start of the game:
```
It is now Brent's turn.
|1||2||3|
|4||5||6|
|7||8||9|
Please provide desired square
```

Player one (Brent) would then input a number 1 through 9 as the desired play square. As an example, Brent put in 6. Because Brent chose 'N' as his symbol, the board then showed:

```
It is now Travis's turn.
|1||2||3|
|4||5||N|
|7||8||9|
Please provide desired square
```

The game will automatically notice a win or draw and end the game.
